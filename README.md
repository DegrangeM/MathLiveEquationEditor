This is a plugin to add a powerfull maths equation editor to tinymce using the [mathlive keyboard](https://cortexjs.io/mathlive/).

The goal was to then create a Moodle plugin using this plugin but I gived up after wasting lots of hours trying to understand how to create a tinymce plugin for moodle.
Feel free to try yourself if you want :)
